The reason for this demo is to show the Automation Technology Club some of the
basics of using the Hologram API, Hologram Dash, and doing some basic message 
passing and handling on the device.

To get started click here [To get started click here](start.md) .  This assumes you have already setup your Dash and activated your SIM. If not head to hologram.io and follow the instructions there. Come back when you are ready.
https://hologram.io/docs/guide/dash/quick-start 

I am also assuming you can setup the Arduino IDE to use the dash.
 https://hologram.io/docs/guide/dash/programming-and-firmware
and that you are able to upload/update sketches on your dash (hologram examples)

Note: I had to run the Arduino IDE as admin for this to work. I also had to run the firmware update tools as admin. Just a hint if it's not working for you. It is kind of outside the scope of this demo.


** This demo is based on the RGBLeds example, and A DHT11 Temperature Sketch found in the Community formus.
